# Bookstore

>The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. You will create an MVP version of it that allows you to: - Display a list of books. - Add a book. - Remove a selected book.

By building this application, I learned how to use React and Redux.

`npm install`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
